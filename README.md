## BERT and LSTM Sentiment Analysis on Reddit Stock Data 

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of stock-related discussions on Reddit, a platform known for its impactful market discussions. The dataset contains positive and negative sentiment labels, and after extensive text pre-processing, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is applied to classify sentiments. This approach combines the strengths of transformer architectures and recurrent neural networks for accurate sentiment classification.
